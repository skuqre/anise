<h1 align='center'>Anisé, a Discord Bot!</h1>
can be called as "skuqred^3" since this is what it would be,<br>
and I think I'm sick of my own name on my own projects.

## What can Anisé do?
as of current she can provide information about NIKKE characters.<br>
this bot also has support of slash commands.

## Why?
it just helps me with playing NIKKE. nothing else<br>
some other stuff (like `/shedidntsaythat`) are added out of fun
<br><br>
some examples of Anisé workin:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img align='top' src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/64UPVND3d.png" /></td>
    <td rowspan='2'><img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/64UP2GovE.png" /></td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
</table>

## Made with
- disnake
- discord.py ([see the Old branch!](https://github.com/skuqre/anise/tree/old))
- <details><summary>my sanity</summary>
  discord.py is just about new to me<br>
  python is something more of a bizarre thing to me as well<br>
  more over, I encountered a lot of shit when I was making some commands
  <br><br>
  you know, discord, I think making slash commands do not have to be<br>
  THIS FUCKING COMPLICATED ‼‼‼‼

## Plans
make it a utility bot and add more features<br>
*actually* learn how this whole damn thing should work<br><br>
...fix "The application did not respond" errors... (I have no clue what causes them in the first place)
